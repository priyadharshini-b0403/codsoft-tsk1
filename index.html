The design includes buttons for numbers, operators, clear, and equal functions.
HTML was used to structure the display and button layout.
CSS was applied to style the interface with a clean and modern look.
JavaScript handles all the logic for performing calculations.
It supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Click events are used to capture user input and update the display in real time.
